                We guarantee 50,000+ Reddit post impressions within 7 days of the first campaign post going live.
                "Impressions" means the post view count shown in Reddit's native analytics.

                The 7-day measurement window begins when the first campaign post goes live.
                If a post is removed by moderators or affected by subreddit policy actions,
                we may reallocate to alternative communities or extend the window to complete delivery.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                If the target isn't reached, we'll either (a) continue posting for up to 7 additional days,
                or (b) issue a full refund, at the client's choice.
