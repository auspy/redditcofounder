            Time slips away fast when you have ADHD. The floating timer sits in
            one corner of every screen so you always see how much is left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Color and a gentle progress ring make minutes feel real. Drag the
            timer where you want and get back to work. Move to menubar to
            completely zone in.
