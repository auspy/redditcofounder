            Everyone's focus style is different. Some need prominent alerts to
            break hyperfocus, while others need gentle nudges that won't disrupt
            their flow state.
          </p>
          <p>
            SupaSidebar offers multiple notification styles - from subtle
            unobtrusive alerts to attention-grabbing fullscreen transitions -
            letting you choose the right level of interruption for different
            situations.

            Break completions might need prominent alerts, while upcoming
            meetings could use gentle reminders. SupaSidebar lets you customize
            notifications for each type of event.

            Set more noticeable alerts for critical events like meeting
            reminders, and subtle notifications for regular timer updates,
            creating the perfect balance for your workflow.

            Too many notifications create distraction and stress, but missing
            important alerts disrupts your productivity. Finding the right
            balance is essential.
          </p>
          <p>
            With SupaSidebar's customizable notification system, you can
            fine-tune exactly when, how, and for what you receive alerts,
            creating an environment that keeps you informed without overwhelming
            your attention.

    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize notifications for different events?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can set different notification styles for various events like timer completions, break reminders, meeting alerts, and task deadlines. Each can have its own style, sound, and prominence level.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do notifications respect Do Not Disturb mode?",
      answer:
        "By default, SupaSidebar respects your system-wide Do Not Disturb settings. However, you can optionally allow critical notifications (like meeting alerts) to bypass DND if needed for your workflow.",

    {
      question: "Can notifications change based on my focus state?",
      answer:
        "Yes, with the Pro version, SupaSidebar can intelligently adjust notification styles based on your detected focus state. If you're in deep focus, it may use more prominent alerts, while using subtler notifications when you're already task-switching.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are notification sounds customizable too?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. You can choose from our library of notification sounds designed for optimal attention without being jarring, or import your own custom sounds for each notification type.",
