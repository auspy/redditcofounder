            Our Calendar Integration connects directly with your Apple Calendar,
            providing smart notifications that ensure you never miss an
            important meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of constantly checking your calendar or being interrupted by
            standard notifications, SupaSidebar provides gentle, timely
            reminders that respect your focus state.

            Standard calendar notifications often go unnoticed during deep
            focus. Our system provides subtle but effective alerts that break
            through focus without jarring you out of flow.

            Customize when and how you're notified before meetings, ensuring you
            have just the right amount of preparation time for different types
            of commitments.

            SupaSidebar doesn't just notify you about meetings - it helps you
            make the most of the time between them. The system automatically
            identifies focus opportunities in your calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have gaps between meetings, SupaSidebar suggests the
            perfect focus session length, helping you maximize productive work
            without risk of running into your next commitment.

  faqQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Which calendar services does SupaSidebar support?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar currently integrates with Apple Calendar, which supports accounts from iCloud, Google, Microsoft Exchange, and other CalDAV providers. This means most major calendar services are compatible through your macOS calendar.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose which calendars trigger notifications?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can select which specific calendars SupaSidebar should monitor for meetings. This allows you to separate work and personal commitments, or focus only on your most important calendars.",
    },
    {
      question: "How far in advance will I be notified about meetings?",
      answer:
        "You can customize notification timing based on meeting type or calendar. For example, you might want a 10-minute heads-up for regular team check-ins, but 30 minutes notice for client presentations to allow preparation time.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can SupaSidebar automatically add focus sessions to my calendar?",
      answer:
        "Yes, with your permission, SupaSidebar can add your completed focus sessions to a designated calendar. This creates a comprehensive record of your productive time and helps you analyze the balance between focus work and meetings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will calendar integration work when I'm offline?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar caches your calendar data, so you'll still receive meeting notifications even when temporarily offline. The system will automatically sync when connection is restored.",
    },
  ],
