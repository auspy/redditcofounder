            When you're in a state of flow, those subtle notification bubbles
            might as well be invisible. SupaSidebar's meeting alerts command
            attention by temporarily taking over your screen with important
            meeting information—making them virtually impossible to miss.
          </p>
          <p>
            No more embarrassing late joins, missing client calls, or that
            panicked "I completely forgot about our meeting" feeling. Stay in
            deep focus knowing that when it truly matters, SupaSidebar will pull
            you back at exactly the right moment.

            No two workflows are the same—that's why SupaSidebar lets you
            customize every aspect of your meeting alerts. Adjust transparency
            levels for different contexts, choose colors that catch your
            attention, select sounds that cut through your focus, and set the
            perfect timing for your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you prefer subtle notifications or attention-demanding
            alerts, you can fine-tune the experience to match your personal
            style and sensitivity. Create different profiles for various meeting
            types—subtle for daily stand-ups, unmissable for client
            presentations.

            SupaSidebar seamlessly connects with your calendar and automatically
            detects all your meetings and events. You're in complete control of
            which events trigger alerts through powerful filtering options based
            on keywords, participants, calendar source, and more.

            Only want alerts for client meetings? Filter by the word "client" in
            the title. Need to prioritize meetings with your boss? Create a
            filter for their name in the attendee list. This intelligent
            filtering system ensures you only get interrupted for what truly
            matters to you.

    {
      question: "How does this differ from regular calendar notifications?",
      answer:
        "Unlike standard calendar notifications that appear in a corner of your screen and are easy to miss, SupaSidebar uses full-screen alerts that are impossible to ignore. It's specifically designed for deep workers and people with ADHD who might otherwise miss subtle notifications when in a state of flow or hyperfocus.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize how much advance notice I receive?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can set custom alert times for different meeting types. For example, you might want a 5-minute warning for internal team meetings but a 15-minute heads-up for client presentations to give yourself preparation time. You can also customize notifications based on keywords in the meeting title or attendees.",
    },

    {
      question: "Can I temporarily disable meeting notifications?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can easily disable calendar notifications directly from SupaSidebar.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will it alert me about all calendar events?",
      answer:
        "You have complete control over which calendars and event types trigger alerts. You can include work calendars while excluding personal ones, or create filtering rules based on meeting attributes like title, attendees, or duration. This ensures you only get alerted for truly relevant meetings.",
