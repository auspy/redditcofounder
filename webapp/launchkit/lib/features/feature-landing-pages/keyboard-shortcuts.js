          <p>
            Every time you move your hand from keyboard to mouse, it breaks your
            concentration and slows you down. Our keyboard shortcuts eliminate
            these micro-disruptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a comprehensive set of shortcuts covering every feature, you
            can operate SupaSidebar with maximum efficiency, keeping your
            attention on your work rather than the tool.
