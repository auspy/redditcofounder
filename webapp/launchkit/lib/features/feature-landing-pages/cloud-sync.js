            Start a focus session on your work Mac, continue it on your personal
            MacBook. Cloud Sync keeps your focus data consistent across all your
            devices.

            Cloud Sync serves as an automatic backup of your focus history,
            tasks, and settings. If you get a new Mac or need to reinstall your
            system, your data remains safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply sign in to your SupaSidebar account on your new device, and
            all your focus history, custom settings, and tasks will be restored
            instantly.

            Mark a task complete on one device, and it's instantly updated
            everywhere. Adjust your Pomodoro settings on your iMac, and they're
            immediately available on your MacBook.
          </p>

            Cloud Sync works silently in the background, ensuring your focus
            ecosystem stays in perfect harmony without requiring any manual
            intervention.

  faqQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Is my data secure in the cloud?",
      answer:
        "Yes, SupaSidebar uses state-of-the-art encryption for all synchronized data. Your information is encrypted both during transfer and at rest in our secure cloud infrastructure. We never access your personal productivity data.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Cloud Sync work offline?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar works completely offline, with Cloud Sync automatically resuming when you reconnect to the internet. Any changes made while offline are queued and synchronized once connectivity is restored.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much data can I sync across devices?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar Pro includes unlimited cloud storage for your productivity data. This includes complete historical records of focus sessions, all tasks (even completed ones), and all custom settings.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if there's a conflict between devices?",
      answer:
        "If you make changes to the same item on multiple devices while offline, our smart conflict resolution will preserve both versions when possible or use the most recent changes as the source of truth.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I control which data gets synchronized?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can customize synchronization settings to include or exclude specific data types. For example, you might choose to sync tasks but not history, or sync everything except certain workspace configurations.",
    },
