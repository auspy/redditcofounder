            Consistency is the key to productivity, but establishing new habits
            can be challenging. Daily Reminders provide the gentle structure you
            need to build lasting focus routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set personalized reminders to start your focus sessions at the same
            time each day, creating a rhythm that transforms focused work from
            an occasional effort into an automatic habit.

            Daily Reminders are designed to support your intentions, not control
            your schedule. The gentle nudges respect your workflow and current
            context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike calendar events that demand immediate attention, these
            reminders serve as supportive cues that help you transition into
            focus sessions at natural breaking points in your day.

      question: "How are Daily Reminders different from calendar events?",
      answer:
        "Unlike calendar events that block specific time slots, Daily Reminders are flexible nudges that help you start focus sessions at consistent times. They're designed to build habits rather than schedule meetings, with gentler notifications that respect your current work state.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set different reminders for different days?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can create custom reminder schedules for each day of the week. For example, you might set earlier focus reminders on Mondays when you're fresh, and later ones on Fridays when you typically have more meetings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the smart timing feature work?",
      answer:
        "The intelligent timing system analyzes your historical focus patterns to identify when you're naturally most productive. It then suggests optimal times for your daily reminders, helping you align your intentional focus sessions with your body's natural rhythm.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I temporarily disable reminders for vacation?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. You can easily pause your reminder schedule for vacations, holidays, or any period when you need a break. The system also integrates with your calendar to automatically adjust when you're out of office.",

    {
      question: "Will reminders become annoying if I ignore them?",
      answer:
        "No, Daily Reminders are designed with respect for your attention. If you consistently ignore a reminder at a certain time, the system will suggest adjusting it to a more suitable time rather than repeatedly interrupting you when you're unavailable.",
