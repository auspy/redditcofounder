            The struggle to maintain focus isn't your fault—it's how your brain
            is wired. The Pomodoro Technique works because it aligns with your
            natural attention cycles, helping you beat distractions and mental
            fatigue.
          </span>
          <span>
            Instead of fighting against attention dips, SupaSidebar's
            implementation harnesses these natural rhythms, creating a
            sustainable productivity system that prevents burnout while
            maximizing your most focused hours.

            challenges.

  faqQuestions: [
    {
      question: "What is the Pomodoro Technique?",
      answer:
        "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as 'pomodoros', the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I use the Pomodoro Timer in SupaSidebar?",
      answer:
        "Simply select a task you want to focus on, set your desired work interval (default is 25 minutes), and click Start. The timer will count down, and when it reaches zero, it will alert you to take a break. After your break, it will prompt you to start another work session. You can customize all timings in the settings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the work and break durations?",
      answer:
        "Yes! SupaSidebar allows you to fully customize your Pomodoro experience. You can set your preferred work interval duration, short break length, long break length, and how many sessions before a long break.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the Pomodoro Timer work when I'm offline?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. The Pomodoro Timer works completely offline once the app is installed on your device, so you can stay productive even without an internet connection.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I see statistics about my Pomodoro sessions?",
      answer:
        "Yes, SupaSidebar keeps track of your Pomodoro sessions, showing you daily and weekly stats about your focus time, completed sessions, and productivity trends. This helps you understand your work patterns and optimize your schedule.",
    },
  ],
