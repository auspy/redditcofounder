            It's not about lack of discipline—your brain is literally wired to
            seek novelty and distraction. SupaSidebar creates a protective
            barrier between you and the digital temptations specifically
            engineered to hijack your attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of exhausting your willpower through constant resistance,
            our intelligent blocking system removes the temptation entirely,
            creating a distraction-free environment where deep focus becomes the
            path of least resistance.

            Not everyone struggles with the same distractions. SupaSidebar lets
            you create personalized blocking rules for the specific websites and
            applications that derail your productivity—whether it's social
            media, news sites, email, games, or any other digital temptation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fine-tune your blocking settings with flexible options like timed
            access, scheduled blocking periods, and allowlist
            capabilities—ensuring the system works with your workflow rather
            than against it.

            34% of our users identified social media as their primary focus
            challenge. SupaSidebar's specialized social media blocking targets
            these particularly addictive platforms with enhanced blocking

            Instead of endless scrolling, you'll be gently redirected to your
            current task when temptation strikes. Over time, this reinforces
            healthier digital habits and reduces the automatic reaching for
            distractions when work gets challenging.

            Consistency is key to productivity. SupaSidebar allows you to
            schedule regular distraction-free periods that activate

            Set it once, and let SupaSidebar handle the rest. Your blocking

  faqQuestions: [
    {
      question: "How does the website and app blocking work?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar uses a advanced system-level blocking that prevents access to distracting websites and applications during your focus sessions. When you try to access a blocked site or app, you'll see a friendly reminder that you're in focus mode. The blocking can be customized with different levels of strictness—from gentle nudges to complete lockout—depending on your preferences.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize which websites and apps are blocked?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. SupaSidebar gives you complete control over your blocking list. You can block specific websites, entire categories (like social media or news), or specific applications. You can also create exceptions for work-related sites or tools you need. The system can even suggest common distractions to block based on your usage patterns.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need temporary access to a blocked site?",
      answer:
        "SupaSidebar offers several options for temporary access. You can request a timed break (e.g., 5 minutes of access), add a site to your allowlist temporarily, or pause blocking briefly. These options provide flexibility while still maintaining accountability—each exception is logged so you can review your patterns later.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can blocking be scheduled for specific times?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can schedule blocking to activate automatically at specific times. For example, you might want to block social media during work hours (9am-5pm) on weekdays but allow access on evenings and weekends. The scheduler supports complex patterns like 'Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10am-2pm' to match your unique routine.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this slow down my browsing or computer performance?",
      answer:
        "No, SupaSidebar's blocking system is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It runs in the background with minimal resource usage and won't slow down your browsing experience or overall computer performance. The system is optimized to provide powerful blocking without any noticeable impact on your system.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for parental controls or team productivity?",
      answer:
        "While SupaSidebar is primarily designed for personal productivity, many parents and team leaders use it to help establish healthy digital boundaries. For team settings, each team member would need to install SupaSidebar on their own device, but workspace configurations can be shared to ensure consistent blocking rules across the team.",
    },
