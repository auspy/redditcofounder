            A cluttered dock can be visually distracting and make it harder to
            find the apps you need. Compact Mode hides SupaSidebar's dock icon
            when not in use, reducing visual noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            This keeps your workspace clean and minimalist while still providing
            all the focus-enhancing benefits of the app through a subtle menu
            bar icon.

            The menu bar icon provides instant access to SupaSidebar's core
            features - start a timer, add a task, or check your progress with a
            single click from any application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The streamlined menu gives you just what you need without
            overwhelming options, making it perfect for quick interactions that
            don't disrupt your workflow.

            Some productivity apps demand constant attention with large windows
            or persistent icons. Compact Mode is built on the philosophy that
            the best productivity tool is one that helps without getting in your
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            SupaSidebar works silently in the background, tracking your focus
            time and managing your tasks while maintaining a minimal presence on
            your desktop.

  faqQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Can I switch between compact mode and normal mode?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can easily toggle between compact mode and normal mode through the preferences. This gives you flexibility to use the full application window when managing tasks or reviewing analytics, and switch to compact mode when you want to minimize distractions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I still get notifications in compact mode?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. All notifications function normally in compact mode, including timer completions, meeting alerts, and scheduled reminders. The notification style follows your preferences regardless of whether the dock icon is visible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does compact mode affect any features?",
      answer:
        "Compact mode only changes how you access SupaSidebar, not what it can do. All features remain fully functional, including timers, task management, analytics, and integrations. The menu bar provides quick access to essential functions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will SupaSidebar start in compact mode automatically?",
      answer:
        "You can set SupaSidebar to launch in compact mode by default. It can also remember your last state, so if you closed it in compact mode, it will open that way next time. This behavior is customizable in preferences.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use keyboard shortcuts in compact mode?",
      answer:
        "Yes, all global keyboard shortcuts work identically in compact mode. In fact, many users combine compact mode with keyboard shortcuts for a completely mouse-free, distraction-free productivity system.",
    },
