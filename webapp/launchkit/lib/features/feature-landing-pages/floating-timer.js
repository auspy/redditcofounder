            Traditional timers get buried under windows, forcing you to switch
            contexts just to check the time. SupaSidebar's floating timer
            elegantly follows you across all applications, ensuring you're
            always aware of your current task and time remaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're coding, designing, writing, or analyzing data, the
            timer remains gently present, keeping you connected to time without
            adding any additional load or forcing you to break concentration.

            Most timers demand attention with jarring ticks, aggressive
            countdowns, and anxiety-inducing designs. SupaSidebar's floating
            timer was crafted with careful attention to cognitive psychology,
            using subtle visual cues that register in your peripheral awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minimal interface shows exactly what you need—your current task
            and time remaining—without unnecessary controls or visual noise.
            It's the difference between a timer that works for you versus one
            that works against you.

            Time anxiety is that constant pressure you feel as seconds tick
            away. SupaSidebar transforms your relationship with time by
            replacing stress-inducing countdowns with gentle visual indicators
            that promote awareness without urgency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The subtle wave animations and progress indicators create a calm
            reminder that time is passing, helping you maintain a healthy pace
            without the constant pressure of racing against the clock—perfect
            for creative work that requires both time boundaries and mental
            freedom.

            Every workflow is unique, which is why SupaSidebar's floating timer
            adapts to your preferences instead of forcing you into a
            one-size-fits-all solution. Customize transparency, size, position,
            and theme to match your personal style and workspace setup.

            Whether you need a prominent reminder or just a subtle hint of time
            passing, the floating timer can be configured to complement your
            concentration style rather than compete with it—giving you the
            perfect level of time awareness for your specific needs.

              flow.
