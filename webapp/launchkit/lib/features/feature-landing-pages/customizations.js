            When your tools clash visually with your environment, it creates
            subtle cognitive friction. SupaSidebar's appearance options let you
            create perfect visual harmony with your desktop theme.

            Whether you prefer dark mode, light mode, or something in between,
            your timer can blend seamlessly with your workspace, reducing visual
            distractions and making it feel like a natural extension of your
            system.
